# Koishi Tetsu v3
The goal of this bot is to take care of all the basic moderation tasks, as well as a few specific functions that are mostly issued from my desires.

The creation will be done in three different steps.
- An API
- The discord part
- A web-application to set the parameters

## API
The API will be RESTful and made with Python, using the Flask Restful library. It'll allow the bot to store and retrieve real time data in a JSON format, easy to parse and to save. Some data might have to be encrypted, to make sure to respect users' privacy.

### API Dependencies :
Here I will list all the python modules you'll have to install to make the API run correctly.
- flask
- flask_restful
- flask_cors

## Discord part
The discord part will simply be acting just like a random bot. It'll answer commands from the users, triggered by specific messages or reactions. The main objective is to provide at least the same amount of functions and quality as its predecessor.

### Launching
To launch this bot, you're first going to need to create a bot account (I let you search for that, there are plenty of documentations, and there will very likely be one in your fisrt language) and to get its token in the 'Bot' side tab. <br>
Once you've done all that, you simply need to start a terminal in the `/JDA_CLIENT` directory and type :
```
gradle run --args="<token>"
```
replacing the <<!---->token> key by the token you retrieved.

### **WARNING**
Before you try starting the bot (and this is especially true if the repository is not the original one (check the corpyrights to see if they match the URL to see it)) you **SHOULD** go and read the [ Main.java ][main] in `/JDA_CLIENT/app/src/main/java/JDA_CLIENT`, looking for the `args[0]` in the `main(String[] args)` method. <br>
This `args[0]` shold **NEVER**, in any case, be transfered elsewhere than in the `JDABuilder` which will send it to the JDA API to connect your JDA instance to the bot. If it is, please, for your own good, do not ever launch the bot.

If you still launched it, please go back to where you got your token (Bot tab of your application in the [ Discord Developer Portal][devportal]) and reset it immediately!

## Web-Application
I'm quite yet to decide how I will realize it exactly, though I know I will have to implement an authentification system. The safest way to make it would be to use discord's one, but I have no idea how they make it work. <br>
Once connected, it will allow the user to see and modify the parameters of a specific server.
