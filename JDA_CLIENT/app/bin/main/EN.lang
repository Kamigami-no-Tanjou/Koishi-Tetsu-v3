hello:This is the text that will be stored in the hello variable.
Line breaks are accepted (and taken into account), as it will check the line after to see if there
is another \: key. #You can also comment lines with a # key.

#Also, if you want to add : and # keys in the text, you will need to put a \ just before, so it
#won't be counted as a key.

commandNameOrOutputTooShort:The command name, or its output is too short! It's like you're telling me to eat the stone you have in your hand, while your hand is empty! \:cry\:
commandDisabledTriggered:I can't do something you told me not to! \:persevere\: use the following command to enable the command\:
manageRolesPermissionLack:Wait, roles? What are roles? That wasn't what I signed for! \:confounded\: I need your permission to manage them...
memberManageRolesPermissionLack:I'm sorry, but I'm not too sure you were allowed to manage roles \:eyes\:
moderateMembersPermissionLack:Mmmh... Sure, but... I'd need you to allow me to moderate members \:point_right\:\:point_left\:
memberManageServerPermissionLack:Stop right there! I can't let you do that, you need the permission to manage the server for that.
mutedCooldownTooHigh:That long?! Best I can do is 672 hours...
mutedCooldownTooLow:Hum, what? I... can't go against the time, I guess? Minimum value is 1 hour.
maxWarningAmountTooLow:If your goal is to ban everyone, this is not the right command. If it's not then you'll need the amount to be at least 1.
banMembersPermissonLack:I could try throwing stones at them so that they would run away from here, but to make it more efficient, I would need you to allow me to ban members...
